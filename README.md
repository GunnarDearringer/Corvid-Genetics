# Project Corvus: The Origins of Belief

Welcome to **Project Corvus**, an experimental thought project exploring the origins of religion, myth, and civilization through the lens of accelerated crow intelligence.

## 🧠 Concept

Crows are among the most intelligent animals on Earth, yet they have never built civilizations.  
What would happen if we rapidly evolved their intelligence to human levels?  
Would they develop beliefs, myths, and religions like we did?

**Project Corvus** imagines this scenario as a way to uncover the true roots of religious thought.

## 🌐 Website

This project includes a modern, animated website built with:

- **TailwindCSS** (for fast and flexible styling)
- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)** (for ultra-smooth animations)
- **ScrollTrigger** (for scroll-based effects)

The website presents the idea, tracks the "research," and imagines the development of crow society and belief systems.
